# Notes: 
.For anyone using Cote::Blocks on windows and using MinGW GCC, if codeblocks launches an error when you compile, go to : Settings-->Complier..-->Linker Settings-->Other linker options--> and write -lwinmm.

.Can be used to rizz up the ladies (use at your own risk).

.Make sure the wav sound file and the .exe / .C file belong to the same parent folder so it doesn't throw out an error.

.If you're on linux, just go fuck yourself (specifically omar lol).

.Don't go around saying it doesn't work unless you applied the first step, and if it doesn't work please provide me with the error ,maybe I could help?
